### Tweet 1 (Hook)
Just launched AXCTL 🚀

macOS automation CLI that saves $3,000/year in time and 98% on AI tokens.

Instead of burning 7,800 tokens per screenshot, use native APIs at 150 tokens/action.

Free tier. No limits.

### Tweet 2 (Problem)
Most AI automation uses GPT-4V/Claude Vision:
• 7,800 tokens per action
• Expensive at scale
• Burns through API budgets fast

At 20M tokens/month ($2/1M), that's $480/year just on screenshots.

There's a better way ↓

---

### Tweet 3 (Solution)
AXCTL uses macOS Accessibility APIs instead of screenshots.

Returns structured JSON, not images.

Same automation capability, 98% cheaper.

Example:
```bash
ax-helper query "Safari"
ax-helper click "button:Submit"
```

150 tokens instead of 7,800.

---

### Tweet 4 (Features - Free)
🆓 FREE TIER (unlimited):

• Control any Mac app
• Desktop automation
• 150 tokens/action
• No usage caps
• No credit card

Perfect for AI agents, automation scripts, or replacing Vision AI.

---

### Tweet 5 (Features - Pro)
💎 PRO TIER ($69/year):

• Everything in Free
• Xcode build automation
• TestFlight uploads  
• App Store Connect API
• 3 machines

Built for iOS devs who ship apps.

---

### Tweet 6 (Use Case - iOS Dev)
Example: Automated iOS build pipeline

```bash
xcode-archive --project MyApp.xcodeproj
xcode-export --archive MyApp.xcarchive
xcode-upload --ipa MyApp.ipa
```

From code → TestFlight in one script.

No Xcode.app required.

---

### Tweet 7 (Use Case - AI Agents)
Example: AI agent controlling Chrome

Instead of:
• Screenshot: 7,800 tokens
• Vision AI: $0.015
• 100 actions: $1.50

With AXCTL:
• JSON query: 150 tokens
• Cost: $0.0003
• 100 actions: $0.03

50x cheaper.

---

### Tweet 8 (ROI Breakdown)
Real savings at 20M tokens/month:

Vision AI: $480/year
AXCTL: $9/year
Token savings: $471/year

Plus time savings:
30 hours/year × $100/hr = $3,000/year

Total value: $3,471/year
Cost: $69/year

**ROI: 50x** 🚀

---

### Tweet 9 (Technical Details)
How it works:

Uses macOS Accessibility APIs (same APIs VoiceOver uses):
• Query UI elements
• Click buttons
• Fill forms
• Read text
• Navigate menus

Returns structured data, not pixels.

Open architecture. MIT licensed core.

---

### Tweet 10 (Pricing Comparison)
Pricing tiers:

FREE: Desktop automation (unlimited)
$9/mo: + iOS tools (1 machine)
$69/yr: + iOS tools (3 machines) ← Best value
$179: Lifetime (5 machines, never pay again)

Try free tier first. Upgrade when you need iOS automation.

---

### Tweet 11 (Getting Started)
Get started:

```bash
npm install -g @axctl/core
ax-helper query "Finder"
```

Free tier works immediately.

For iOS automation:
1. Get license: https://axctl.dev
2. Run: axctl activate YOUR-KEY
3. Start building

### Tweet 12 (CTA)
Built this because I was burning $$$ on AI tokens for iOS automation.

Figured other indie hackers would benefit.
