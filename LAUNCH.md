**Title:** AXCTL – Command-line macOS automation that's 98% cheaper than Vision AI

**Text:**

Hi HN,

I built AXCTL - a command-line toolkit for macOS automation that uses native APIs instead of Vision AI screenshots.

**The problem:** Most AI automation tools use screenshot-based approaches (GPT-4V, Claude Vision) which burn 7,800 tokens per action. At scale, this gets expensive fast.

**The solution:** AXCTL uses native macOS Accessibility APIs that return structured JSON instead of screenshots. Same automation capability, but uses only 150 tokens per action - **98% cheaper**.

**What it includes:**

- Desktop automation (control any Mac app via Accessibility APIs)
- Xcode build automation (archive, export, upload to TestFlight)
- App Store Connect API helper (manage apps, submissions, metadata)

**Free tier:** Desktop automation is unlimited and free. 

**Paid tier:** iOS automation tools ($69/year or $179 lifetime).

**Example savings at 20M tokens/month:**
- Vision AI approach: $480/year
- AXCTL approach: $9/year
- **You save: $471/year on tokens alone**

Plus you save ~30 hours/year in manual work (worth $3,000 if you value your time at $100/hr).

Built this because I was burning too much on AI tokens for iOS app automation. Figured other indie hackers and small teams would benefit.

Command-line macOS automation that's 98% cheaper than Vision AI.

Instead of burning 7,800 tokens per screenshot, use native APIs at 150 tokens per action.

At 20M tokens/month, that's $471/year saved.

Why this matters:

Most AI automation uses GPT-4V/Claude Vision → expensive at scale
